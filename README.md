# CyberSec RAG Alert: AI-Powered Cybersecurity Advisory Watcher
A smart, local-first cybersecurity advisory monitoring system that scrapes, analyzes, ranks, and alerts you of critical threats â€” powered by open-source LLMs, FAISS vector search, and automated scheduling.

# Project Overview
CyberSec RAG Alert is a Python-based automation tool designed to help security engineers and analysts:
- Automatically track cybersecurity advisories from Cybersecurity websites
- Analyze and summarize advisories using a local LLM (like Phi-2 or Mistral)
- Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and FAISS vector search to prioritize and contextualize alerts
- Alert users on a daily/weekly basis via email or terminal
